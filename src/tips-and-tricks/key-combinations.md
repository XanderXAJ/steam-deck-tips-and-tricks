# Key Combinations

## While turned off

- Volume+ & Power: [Boot in to UEFI](../advanced/boot-into-bios.md)
- Volume- & Power: Boot Menu
    - This allows you to boot from an external (e.g. USB) medium, or from a different partition in multi-partition setups.

Note that, contrary to some suggestions you might have seen, there is currently no way to reset the UEFI/BIOS settings with a key combination.

## In Game Mode

**Pro-Tip:** Hold either the `Steam` or `Quick Access (...)` button to see all the available shortcuts.

- `Steam`/`...` & up on left analogue stick: Screen brightness up
- `Steam`/`...` & down on left analogue stick: Screen brightness down
    - I prefer using `...` as it means I can use both hands instead of having to Monster Hunter claw with just the left hand.
    - If you use this shortcut in a non-Steam game, Steam Input will revert to a different controller layout. Press either `Steam`/`...` twice to open and close a menu and fix Steam Input to the correct profile again.
